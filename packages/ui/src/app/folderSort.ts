/**
 * The session panel's folder SORT — the one the user picks from the panel's
 * sort menu, as opposed to the manual arrangement the user drags
 * (`folderOrder.ts`) and the host's listing order everything starts from.
 *
 * ## Why client-side, when the host's `a list --sort` exists
 *
 * The host sorts SESSIONS; the panel draws FOLDERS. A host-side `--sort name`
 * orders the session list, and the folder projection (`buildDirectories`) then
 * orders folders by first encounter in that list — which is the session name's
 * order, not the folder's, and falls apart wherever the two diverge (a worktree
 * folder, a renamed tag, a folder holding two sessions sorted apart). The row
 * the user sees is the folder row, so the sort has to run at the folder level,
 * and the folder level exists only here.
 *
 * Two more reasons, both about reach: the tmux-fallback path
 * (`PocketshellClient`) has no `--sort` to pass, and a client-side comparator
 * is the one sorting both backends answer the same way — which matters because
 * the panel never says which backend it is showing. And a pure projection over
 * the store's list survives the five-second poll the way the manual arrangement
 * does (`folderOrder.ts`'s argument): it is re-APPLIED on every recompute, so
 * nothing races the refresh.
 *
 * The host's listing keeps its own default (`accessed`) and keeps owning the
 * order the tab bar and the create flow read; this module only reorders the
 * panel's folder rows.
 *
 * ## Within roots, never across them
 *
 * The same rule the manual drag obeys (`canDropFolderAt`), and for the same
 * reason: a root is a real directory on the host or one the user registered,
 * and its header names it. Sorting is not allowed to move `~/git/dataops`
 * under `~/tmp`, because the row's own tooltip would contradict its position
 * the moment the user hovered it. The root SEQUENCE — registered order, or
 * first-appearance, with `other` pinned last — is the grouping's declared
 * output and is left exactly as `groupSessionsIntoRoots` produced it.
